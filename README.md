### Hi there, I'm Hung ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a data lover who enjoys exploring how data can leverage businesses and how we can tell compelling stories from it. Through my studies in Data Science (major), Statistics, and Economics (minor), I have developed the core skills necessary to excel as a Data Analyst. However, I am not content with merely acquiring theoretical knowledge and understanding. I aspire to apply my expertise and abilities to real-world situations and challenges. That is why I am keen to obtain practical experience and further refine my skills in the field of data analysis. I am confident that with our collaboration, I can become a true data practicioner who tells great business stories out of data. Iâ€™m excited and open to any opportunity to demonstrate my ability.
