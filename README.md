### Hi there, I'm Hung ðŸ‘‹
I am a data lover - how it surrounds every aspect of our lives and how we can tell great stories out of it. Throughout my coursework in Data Science, Statistics and Economics, I am able to learn the very core skills of a Data Analyst. All that I am missing is experiences, which is a very important piece of puzzle that I long to obtain in order to fully picture myself as a true data practictioner. I believe you can help me with that, and I am most excited to show you what I can do!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a second-year in Data Science, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the data analysis position, preferablly as a Game Data analyst. I have achieved a solid proficiency in Python/R/SQL, proper training in Statistics/Machine Learning/Information Visualization and a good understanding of economics. 
- ðŸŒ± I usually brainstoorm ideas about cool projects I can do to improve my skills as a hobby. 
- ðŸ’¬ Besides data, I am also interested in developing AI models and web designs. I used to be a ReactJS developer.
