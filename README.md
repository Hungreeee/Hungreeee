### Hi there, I'm Hung 👋

Through my studies in Data Science (major), Statistics, and Economics (minor), I have developed the core skills necessary to excel as a Data Analyst.

That is why I am keen to obtain practical experience and further refine my skills in the field of data analysis. I am confident that with our collaboration, I can become a true data practicioner who tells great business stories out of data.
